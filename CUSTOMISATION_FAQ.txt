-------------------------------------------------------------
Customisations should be added to your .emacs file in your home directory.
To create a .emacs use Emacs to open a file called "~/.emacs".
The ~ directory is shorthand for your HOME directory.

For example customisations look at the default Smallworld customisations
in "sw_defaults.el", "occasional.emacs" and "developer.emacs".
These are available from the SW->Customise submenu.

Emacs maintainers:
-----------------

A "local" subdirectory structure is provided for addition of local
site packages.  This is empty except for a subdirs.el file and is
structured to appear first in the load-path, to allow for overrides
and newer versions of the shipped packages.  This is useful if you
maintain a central shared Emacs installation. See README file.

Additional generic configuration/setup code can be placed
in default.el or in site-start.el.

If you must use site-start.el, note that users have much less
control over their Emacs environment. I use site-start.el to
preconfigure certain variables but not to load packages.

For example, I configure M-x mail to be able to work using the
local SMTP mail environment. This is for site-start.el since it is
unlikely to be different for different users in an organisation and
because the configuration itself only consists of setting
variables, users can still have the opportunity to override the
settings in their .emacs.

I recommend that you should carefully consider whether you actually
*enable* extra functionality by default since it may be quite
difficult for your users to disable it if it is a feature that they
do not like.  This makes it easier for users to be able to control
the customisations in their Emacs session.
