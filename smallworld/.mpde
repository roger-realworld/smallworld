;;This file is used as a template for the mpde-configuration-file used by mpde.
;;The code contained here is to make it so that the user need only
;;load their version of this file and it will then load MPDE and configure it.
;;When users define their own configurations, this data will be appended to their copy
;;of this file.

;; The main thing that needs to be considered is where does the user want
;; load-path to pick up the code from?
;; Ideally this should always be in the following preference:
;;
;;     Master   then
;;     current MPDE configuration then
;;     Emacs site lisp (if a local install)
;;
;; In practice however, with MPDE loaded, the site-lisp directory of a
;; local installation will NEVER be accessed.
;;
;; But, if the user ever needs to use Emacs' local install site lisp
;; then they simply comment out the loading of their copy of this file
;; from their .emacs file.

;; Record that MPDE has been installed.
(setq mpde-boot-installed load-file-name)

;; Load MPDE Bootstrap code
(load "~/mpde-boot")

;; Setup up user interaction after this file is loaded.
(eval-after-load "~/.mpde" '(mpde-boot-after-load))

;; New configuration definitions are appended to this file
